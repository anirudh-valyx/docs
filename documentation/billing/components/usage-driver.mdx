title: "Usage Driver"
---

A **Usage Driver** defines how usage is measured in the system.  It determines the quantity based on which a **Fee Component** is billed.

For example, Imagine you're offering a cloud storage service.

- **Fee Component**: `Storage Charges`  This is the invoice line item representing the cost of storing data.
- **Usage Driver**: `Storage Used` This tracks how much storage space a customer consumes — typically measured in gigabytes (GB) per month.

While the system internally measures usage using the usage driver `(Storage Used)`, this raw metric isn’t shown directly on the invoice. Instead, the invoice displays the fee component `(Storage Charges)` along with the billed amount. The usage driver to fee component mapping allows you to:

- Track usage in technical units (e.g. GB, API calls)
- Translate it into meaningful, customer-facing charges

> This separation makes your billing more flexible, allowing you to change how you measure usage without changing how it’s presented to your customer.
