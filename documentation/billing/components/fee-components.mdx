title: "Fee Component"
---

A Fee Component represents a specific service or item that you charge your customers for.\
It appears as one or more line items in your customer’s invoice.

For example, if you're a logistics company, you might define "Courier Charges", "Tracking Charges" as fee components. If you are a SaaS company, "API charges" might be one of the fee components that you might use. Each fee component includes details like:

- Name
- Description
- HSN code (if applicable) etc.

The usage for a fee component is based on **Usage Drivers** — which define how consumption is measured (e.g., number of deliveries, weight, distance).

### **Fee Component Tags**

The same fee component may sometimes have different prices. While a common reason is customer-specific pricing, other factors can also influence this variation.

For example, AWS charges different rates for the same service depending on the region. Similarly, an e-commerce SaaS platform might price the same service differently for different brands of the same customer.

We treat this as different variations of same fee components. This can be achived using tags which are essentially key value pair(s) which can be attached to fee components.

For example, for AWS use it would look like - 

| Region         |
| -------------- |
| us-east-1      |
| ap-south-1     |
| ap-southeast-1 |

Multiple tags can also be applied to a fee component. In that case all combinations would be considered.

| Brand   | Location   |
| ------- | ---------- |
| Brand-1 | Location-1 |
| Brand-1 | Location-2 |
| Brand-2 | Location-1 |
| Brand-2 | Location-2 |
