### ðŸ“˜ Notes

- The API is idempotent based on eventId.
- Use usageReferenceId for batch-level billing or to logically group usage activity.
- Invalid or unmatched tags will result in event rejection due to missing rate card linkage.
- Always ensure that eventTimestamp falls within the contract validity period.
