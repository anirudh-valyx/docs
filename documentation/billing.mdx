## Fee Component

A Fee Component represents a specific service or item that you charge your customers for.\
It appears as one or more line items in your customer’s invoice.

For example, if you're a logistics company, you might define "Courier Charges", "Tracking Charges" as fee components. If you are a SaaS company, "API charges" might be one of the fee components that you might use. Each fee component includes details like:

- Name
- Description
- HSN code (if applicable) etc.

The usage for a fee component is based on **Usage Drivers** — which define how consumption is measured (e.g., number of deliveries, weight, distance).
