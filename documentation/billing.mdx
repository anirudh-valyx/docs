## Fee Component

A Fee Component represents a specific service or item that you charge your customers for.\
It appears as one or more line items in your customer’s invoice.

For example, if you're a logistics company, you might define "Courier Charges", "Tracking Charges" as fee components. If you are a SaaS company, "API charges" might be one of the fee components that you might use. Each fee component includes details like:

- Name
- Description
- HSN code (if applicable) etc.

The usage for a fee component is based on **Usage Drivers** — which define how consumption is measured (e.g., number of deliveries, weight, distance).

## Usage Driver

A **Usage Driver** defines how usage is measured in the system.  It determines the quantity based on which a **Fee Component** is billed.

For example, Imagine you're offering a cloud storage service.

- **Fee Component**: `Storage Charges`  This is the invoice line item representing the cost of storing data.

- **Usage Driver**: `Storage Used` This tracks how much storage space a customer consumes — typically measured in gigabytes (GB) per month.

While the system internally measures usage using the usage driver `(Storage Used)`, this raw metric isn’t shown directly on the invoice. Instead, the invoice displays the fee component `(Storage Charges)` along with the billed amount. The usage driver to fee component mapping allows you to:

- Track usage in technical units (e.g. GB, API calls)
- Translate it into meaningful, customer-facing charges

> This separation makes your billing more flexible, allowing you to change how you measure usage without changing how it’s presented to your customer.
