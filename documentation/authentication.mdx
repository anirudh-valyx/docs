# Authentication

All Valyx API requests require authentication using a signature-based header.  
If the signature is missing or invalid, the API will respond with an **HTTP 401 Unauthorized** error.

## Header Required

| Header Name         | Required | Description |
| ------------------- | -------- | ----------- |
| `X-Valyx-Signature` | Yes      | The HMAC signature used to verify the authenticity of the request. |

---

## How It Works

The `X-Valyx-Signature` is generated using your **Valyx API Secret**.  
When you send a request:

1. Concatenate specific request components (method, path, timestamp, and body) into a string.
2. Sign the string using **HMAC-SHA256** with your API Secret.
3. Encode the result as a hexadecimal string.
4. Add it to the request headers as `X-Valyx-Signature`.

## Example Request

```bash
curl -X GET "https://api.valyx.com/billing/usageDriver/filter" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "X-Valyx-Signature: 7d6a9b8c3f1a4e..." 
```
